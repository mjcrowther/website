So I started a company called **[Red Door Analytics](https://reddooranalytics.se)**. Here's the highlights:

- We're a consultancy company specialising in advanced statistical methods, software development, with a general focus on survival analysis.
- Our **[Products](https://reddooranalytics.se/products)** page details the new home for our freely available software packages including [`merlin`](https://reddooranalytics.se/products/merlin) and [`multistate`](https://reddooranalytics.se/products/multistate).
- We provide a range of **[Services](https://reddooranalytics.se/services)** to our clients, including expert biostatistics consulting, software development and product application.
- We are developing a range of **[Training Courses](https://reddooranalytics.se/serives/training)** on cutting-edge statistical methods, including joint modelling and multi-state survival modelling.
- Our **[new blog page](https://reddooranalytics.se/blog)** is up and running, with most of the material from this website now moved over (and updated!). Related, we have a curated **[Tutorials page](https://reddooranalytics.se/resources/tutorials)**, which groups together blog posts into areas such as survival analysis, joint modelling, etc.
- Meet our **[Team Members](https://reddooranalytics.se/about)**, who are research active biostatisticians - check out our **[Publications page](https://reddooranalytics.se/research/publications)** to read about our latest work.
